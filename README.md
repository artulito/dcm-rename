## How to install this script in Windows

1. Install python, make sure the python command is available in your PATH
2. Put both file dcm-rename.bat and dcm-rename.py script in your PATH
 (I put them in my user folder C:\Users\Lenovo, which is already in my PATH)
2. Go to the folder that you want to batch process. This folder should contain dicom files that you want to be renamed
4. Open Terminal app in the folder
5. Input the command
  
  dcm-rename "path/to/folder"

  OR, if inside the target folder:

  dcm-rename .
